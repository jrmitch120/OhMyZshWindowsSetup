By default, zsh tries to run background jobs at a lower priority, which Windows won't let it do. A good workaround is to put

case $(uname -a) in
   *Microsoft*) unsetopt BG_NICE ;;
esac

in your .zshrc file. That alters zsh's default behavior and fixes the problem entirely, in my experience.

# Shut off beep on windows OhMyZsh
# Add the following to ~/.zshrc
unsetopt beep

# [Cmder] Show only active windom in taskbar hover
